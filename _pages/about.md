I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Photonics Center at Boston University, where I earned my Ph.D. degree in 2023. Prior to this, I obtained my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Tsinghua University in 2016 and Chongqing University in 2013, respectively. My research primarily revolves around the development of metamaterials aimed at manipulating magnetic fields in both temporal and spatial dimensions, with a focus on enhancement, confinement, and editing. I investigate methodologies that integrate metamaterials, MEMS, algorithm-enabled structural design, and electronics to engineer mechanically adaptive devices and systems. These innovations find applications in various magnetic field-based domains, including wireless powering, monitoring, actuating, and imaging.

I have authored/co-authored around 20 peer-reviewed articles published in renowned journals such as Advanced Materials, Advances Science, Microsystem & Nanoengineering, among others. My work has been featured in various popular media outlets, such as Science Daily, Medical Republic, Healthcare-in-Europe, Medhealth Outlook, Physics World, Phys.org.
