I am currently a postdoctoral Associate in Prof. Xin Zhang’s lab at Boston University, where I also obtained my Ph.D. degree in 2023. I received my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Tsinghua University in 2016 and Chongqing in 2013, respectively. My research primarily focuses on developing metamaterials to manipulate (enhance, confine, and edit) magnetic fields temporally and spatially. I explore methods integrating metamaterials, MEMS, algorithm enabled structural design, and electronics to create mechanically adaptive devices and systems for various magnetic field based applications including wireless powering, monitoring, actuating, and imaging.

I have authored/co-authored around 20 peer-reviewed articles published in renowned journals such as Advanced Materials, Advances Science, Microsystem & Nanoengineering, among others. My work has been featured in various popular media outlets, such as Science Daily, Medical Republic, Healthcare-in-Europe, Medhealth Outlook, Physics World, Phys.org.
