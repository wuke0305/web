I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the Photonics Center at Boston University, where I earned my Ph.D. degree in 2023. Prior to this, I obtained my Master’s and Bachelor’s degrees from Tsinghua University in 2016 and Chongqing University in 2013, respectively. 

My research primarily revolves around the development of metamaterials aimed at manipulating and editing electric and magnetic fields in both temporal and spatial dimensions. I investigate methodologies that integrate metamaterials, microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), algorithm-enabled structural design, and electronics to engineer mechanically adaptive devices and systems. These innovations find applications in various near-field based domains, including magnetic resonance imaging, wireless powering, sensing, and reading.

I have authored/co-authored around 20 peer-reviewed articles published in renowned journals such as Science Advances, Advanced Materials, Advanced Science, Microsystem & Nanoengineering, among others. My work has been featured in various popular media outlets, such as Science Daily, Medical Republic, Healthcare-in-Europe, Medhealth Outlook, Physics World, Phys.org.
